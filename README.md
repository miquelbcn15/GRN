# Multi-scale modelling and simulation of a gene regulatory system
Performance analysis of simulations using Gillespie and Quasi Stationary Stochastic Approximation Algorithm applied to a gene regulatory system. 
This project is included in the course of Applied Stochastic Processes taken at the Master in Modelling for Science and Engineering at University of Barcelona.

## How to obtain results
It is required gnuplot, gcc compiler and gsl library.

```bash
bash grn_example.sh
